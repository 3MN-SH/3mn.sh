# What is this
This is my personal website. It is very incomplete and full of very bad practices, because I am not a webdev, and I don't know what a lot of best practices are. I did my best to follow what I thought was "good practice".

I started with the intent to make this website customizable, and discovered that it is not very customizable because I don't really know how consistent spacing works. 

# How to host locally
1. Make sure [Jekyll/Ruby](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/windows/) are both installed on your host device.

2. Fetch the repo
```
git clone <REPO_URL>
```

3. Navigate to the repo folder 
```
cd <REPO_NAME>
```

4. Run `bundle` in the root folder of the repo.
```
bundle
```

5. Run `jekyll serve` and host the website.
```
jekyll serve
```
