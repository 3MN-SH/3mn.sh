So, this is **MY** page. I've been told several times throughout my life that I tend to be discrete about my interests, and to be fair, *I am really bad at talking about myself*. So to combat this, I've decided to make a "my" page, which has an absurd amount of information about myself, probably enough to profile my existence throughout the internet (which is funny because my career is devoted to the cybersecurity industry).

Anyway, if you didn't catch it on the landing page, my name is Shane. I'm a bit of a spread-thin jack-of-all trades person who's still trying to figure out what I'm best at in the world. Throughout my life, I haven't really found myself fitting into a box anywhere, and I reached a point where I needed to make a box to belong to. This website is that box - my own little corner of the internet to pour myself into.

My goal with this place is to eventually help someone through something niche and create something inspiring, whether it be a solution to a problem or an some abstract answer to a feeling. Through a lot of reflection, I've discovered that the only way to really do that is to "make things" and let people see them, regardless of the quality. So, I took some time to make this place for myself with the so that I can get comfortable at being bad at a lot of things. This is my space to be myself and learn in public.

The rest of this page has an absurd amount of stuff about myself, because I rarely get the opportunity to talk about myself honestly. So I'm going to talk about myself because this is my website, and I can do that.
