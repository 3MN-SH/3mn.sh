It's four A.M. — driving slow.
Yellow streaks, orange cones,
Parallax in the night glow.
I'm all alone on the road.

It's quiet — the A.C. blows.
Dead zone, no phone,
And not a soul knows,
I'm all alone on the road.

It's raining — the omen shows.
Shallow breaths, slack pose,
"Please wait, I'm almost home."
I'm all alone on the road.

It's pouring — it echoes.
Vision blears, paint narrows,
And tears swell as though,
I'm all alone on the road.
