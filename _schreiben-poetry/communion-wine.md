It matters not 
     that days sober,
End up counted 
     and suffered—
A midnight prayer 
     and no shoulder,
Shall still bring thirst to 
     the cupboard.

It matters not 
    that wine bottles,
End up shelved 
    or shattered—
The air of communion 
     and gospel,
Entices doubt from 
     the bastard.

It matters not 
     that forgiveness,
Provide salvation 
     and deliverance—
The facade of joy 
     and togetherness,
Leads one toward tempting 
    the indifference.

It matters not 
     that sin is absolved,
The tongue is still human—
     Stained.
The desire to belong 
     and resolve,
Drives a drunkard toward
     the devil; Disdain.
