Face tugged down,
Watching the tread,
Of the grass drowned
By the shoe to ground.
The air is coming alive,
With summer's gentle kneel.
Another dandelion died,
Under weight of the heel.
Steady to the path,
Through the clovers,
That comfortingly lie flat,
Safely by the flowers,
Left to chance,
As each step placed,
Yields a moment to glance.
Keep haste. Keep haste.
