What compels the soul, 
From the bed to dole?
From boots to door,
For a midnight stroll?

The crack of gravel rhythm,
Brings crickets from lull to listen.
And the gleam of glimmering stars,
Casts just enough hope for vision.

Suddenly, a rustle breaks the hush,
With a crack from the thicket brushâ€”
Every sense parallel with each stalk of corn,
Every reason to fear, yet absent to rush.
