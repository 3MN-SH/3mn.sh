In the cracks of the bricks
By the house in the sticks,
Grows a stem and bulb, lone—
And one wish that it holds.
With a hope to be picked, 
It stands tall and affixed.
Soon, along comes a soul,
During a midnight stroll.
Down sits they on the rocks,
With no shoes, and no socks.
In the damp summer cold,
A dandelion is pulled.
Their lips purse, gaze locked.
Hesitation—they stop.
Was it their wish to blow?
Or someone else's? Stolen?
