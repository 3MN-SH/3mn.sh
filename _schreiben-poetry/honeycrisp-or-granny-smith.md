It was my father's end of winter.
And my lively spring horizon, 
Where he gave apple seeds to pit.
I found soil in the spring, 
And spread myself thin,
As I tended the saplings.
My father died in the summer,
And I inherited his wondering,
About apple blossoms in the orchard.
But before I could muse, it was fall.
It's Harvest time; I must pick a tree.
The cold bodes â€“ my apples will rot.
