Do others see what dithers?
Amidst the drudgery, 
    drama, 
         and day,
The shadows that dole their dreads?

Do others wish them to die?
Amidst their diligence, 
    dire, 
        and due,
The nameless grip in their depths?

Do others find it drivel?
Amidst a dream, 
    desired, 
        and doomed,
The warm cusp that it deserves?
