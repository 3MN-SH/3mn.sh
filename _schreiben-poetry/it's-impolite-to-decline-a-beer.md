title: It's Impolite to Decline a Beer
date: 2025-08-03

Forced to have
Drunk family,
That gets one sober
On quitting.

Forced to write
Sober poetry,
That gets one drunk
On yearning.

Forced to watch
Drunk friends,
That gets one drunk
On isolating.

Forced to confront,
Sober pressure,
That gets one sober
On drinking.
