The stroke of the pen
Does not know when
The err will come - 
Just that it is done

It knows not of perfection,
Just the occassional ~~misdirection~~ correction.
We ought to be like the ink - 
Adapting to our think.

Some get stuck in the **obsession**
And forget the page's simple lesson - 
That the other half of doing, 
Is simply letting it be done.
