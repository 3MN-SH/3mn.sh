title: On Thursday

It may have been a Wednesday, 
When I noticed the stain from yesterday,
My clothes were already worn,
And the onset grease was forming.

Slogging again to my desk and screen, 
To continue my Google search for meaning.
A disheveled routine of YouTube and coffee,
To tackle again; How do I become me?

The countless tutorials I'm consuming,
That satiates my dopamine rush for 'doing'.
I'll just keep hoping and pretending,
That on Thursday I might be something.
