Where, o' where, 
    did all of th' beautiful muses go?
Gods, Goddesses, 
    they are all people we know!
Poets, Painters, 
    Have ye ne'er Salvation in a lover's lips?
Songs, sculptures;
    Shrines! Yet thee lack divine worship!
Lost, we are lost,
    that passion should wane after Lust.
Truth! Truth I say!
     Sex is a canvas; an' we are th' brush!
Paint, But thy paint,
     It may dry, an' palettes may stray.
Dears, o' my dears,
     it's seldom th' colors, rather th' chase.
Obsess! Caress!
     Lick yer' brush; play with yer' paint!
Romanticize! Fantasize!
     Hunger th' Release, for that â€” we pray!
