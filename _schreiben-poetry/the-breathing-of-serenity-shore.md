Ten-thousand waves,
Crashed, swelled, billowed,
From ten-thousand winds,
Rolling in draves.

Ten-thousand tides,
Spat, chewed, swallowed,
All the footsteps that came,
And the sandy pride.

Ten-thousand stones,
Tumbled, tossed, turned,
Delivered to a child, 
Who canâ€™t skip her own.

Ten-thousand souls,
Here, passed, going,
Part of the moment,
Playing in the shoal.
