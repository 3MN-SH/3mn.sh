I am a pretty heavy boardgame geek, I'll be honest. I currently own over 50+ boardgames, although they really don't see as much playtime as they should. In anycase, I've definitely developed a few personal favorites over the years:
- Catan (With expansions)
- Two Rooms and a Boom
- Deception: Murder in Hong Kong
- Scythe (With expansions)
- One Night Ultimate Werewolf (With expansions)
- Pandemic

Honestly, now that I type this out, I think I'm just a sucker for social deduction. I'm working on getting Blood on the Clocktower, I promise.
