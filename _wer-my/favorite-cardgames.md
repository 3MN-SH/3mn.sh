Now, when I say card games, I'm sure that people imagine TCGs (which I do enjoy a couple, such as Magic the Gathering and Pokemon), but what I really mean is classic card games, ones that can be played with a deck of cards. I have an abnormal amount of games crammed into my head: 
- Euchre (Obligatory for where I live)
- Hearts
- Six Card Golf
- GOPS
- Spades
- Bullshit
- Kemps
- Crazy Eights
- Egyptian Ratscrew
- Cribbage
- Solitaire
