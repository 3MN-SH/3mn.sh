My favorite color used to be green, hand down. Not sure what happened, but as I got older, I started to like purple more. So as it stands, this is the order for my favorite colors:
- <span class="color-square" style="background: #4242FF"></span>#4242FF - 42 Indigo (At least that's what I call it) 
- <span class="color-square" style="background: #0000FF"></span>#0000FF - Solid Blue
- <span class="color-square" style="background: #FFFFFF"></span>#FFFFFF - Solid White
- <span class="color-square" style="background: #50C880"></span>#50C880 - Emerald Green
- <span class="color-square" style="background: #FF0080"></span>#FF0080 - Hot Pink
