Bit of a weird section to have, but I've found that by having questions that I repeatedly ask myself, my life ends up a little clearer. These are questions that I find are extremely valuable to query when working in the present.
- What is something that you need to hear right now?
- What would you do if you had ten times more agency than you currently have?
- What is the metaphor for the art that you want to make?
- Are you holding back?
