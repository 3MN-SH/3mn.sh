I don't know how much I believe the legitimacy of personality tests. To some degree, I think they're useful for gauging a surface level analysis of how one might decide to make decisions or actions. In any case, I intend to share my own assessments. I found them to be *mostly* accurate. I tend to retake these tests every 1-2 years. 

## Meyer Briggs:
- INFJ-A 

## Enneagram Test:
- 5w4

## Big Five (OCEAN):
- Openness - 78
- Conscientiousness - 63
- Extraversion - 47
- Agreeableness - 80
- Neuroticism - 39
