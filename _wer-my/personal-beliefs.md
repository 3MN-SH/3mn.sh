This is a really touchy area for me, particularly because of how people choose to define belief. I choose to interpret 'belief' as "repititous and demonstrative action that supports a result in a material way". This personal definition of belief is important to explain because I think that people tend to couple [ideals](/my/personal-ideals/) alongside their beliefs, and I find that ideals and beliefs are two very separate distinctions. 

In any case, these are some beliefs I've found that (at least from my own analysis) fit the definition that I have laid out: 
- Quality of living is based on quality of questioning.
- People are a product of their environment.
- Everyone knows something that you don't.
