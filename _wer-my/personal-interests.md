This list started randomly on a piece of paper. I found it useful to categorize my interests based on whether or not I wanted them, and into four categories: *active*, *passive*, *past*, *backlog*. Doing this alongside deciding whether or not I was pleased with their placement was really useful for me sometimes in deciding whether or not what I was doing was actually in alignment with what I wanted.

游릴 = *Content with placement of this interest.*
游린 = *Not content with placement of this interest.*
