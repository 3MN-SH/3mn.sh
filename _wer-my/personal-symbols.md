Another strange category, but something I find worth sharing about myself. I have a small list of symbols that I find myself aligning with. Not sure if anyone else experiences this feeling of being drawn to certain symbols that call to their identity, but there are mine:

# Symbols
- White crow
- Four leaf clover
- Willow tree
- Black and white checkerboard pattern
